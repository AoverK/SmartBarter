# About Smart Barter
The main theme of this Web3athon submission is shared below.

## Hyperlocal Themes
1. How People Transact with the Disappearance of Cash
2. Sustaining Small Business
3. Property Ownership

## Problem
When looking to buy goods and services from individuals and businesses online people often may not have the same way of paying. This leads to a gap in the marketplace that doesn’t account for the way business actually takes place. 

## Who
People and businesses all over the world need a solution for exchanging value for value. It might show up as a farmer accepting a bushel of carrots in exchange for 10 pounds of cabbage. It might show up as an artist exchanging graphic design services in return for a car repair from a mechanic. 

## Why
The purpose of technology and blockchains is to help account for the decentralized, local and borderless way that commerce takes place. 

## Name/Description/How

 Barter uses the tokenization of goods and services to help enable the trading of these assets for each other either using one time, recurring or milestone based transactions. Within the ecosystem, people can trade for existing blockchain tokens like fungible or non-fungible tokens on various chains or they can define and create new tokens which represent a new good or service whether digital or physical. People can also trade multiples or bundles of goods or services or use the native ecosystem stablecoin. To help showcase generational wealth, we’ll leverage verification of real world business ownership to help showcase verified business owners and their goods and services.
